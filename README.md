This repository holds several objects used in AMD's The Bring Up YouTube series, episode 31 - Framework.

These tiles are for the Framework Desktop system, used to customize the front panel. The base **Framework Tiles - Skeletonized.stl** file is a reinforced and ventilated version of their original model optimized for at-home 3D printing. These back plates should be printed using a 2mm nozzle in a PLA or PLA+ filament with decent flexibility and toughness.

The additional files, **AMD Logo**, **Wavey**, and **Black Slatted Tile** are meant to be glued to the top of the base **Skeletonized** file to make at-home printing easier. Superglue is good for this use case, but be sure to pick an adhesive that works with the filament you are printing in (PETG is notorious for poor adhesive compatibility).
